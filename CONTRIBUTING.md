Contributing to [PocketDial]
Thank you for considering contributing to [PocketDial]! To ensure a smooth collaboration process and maintain the quality of the project, please adhere to the following basic expectations when submitting code contributions.

1. Follow the Code Style Guidelines
Adhere to the project's coding style and formatting standards (e.g., indentation, naming conventions, etc.). Refer to the [STYLE_GUIDE.md] file (if applicable) or follow common conventions for the language used.
Use linters or formatters (e.g., Prettier for JavaScript, Black for Python) if specified in the project setup.

2. Write Clear Commit Messages
Write concise and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.
Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X").
If addressing a specific issue, include the issue number (e.g., "Fix #123: Resolve login bug").

3. Test Your Code
Ensure your code works as intended and does not break existing functionality.
If the project includes tests, run them locally before submitting your changes (e.g., npm test, pytest, etc.).
Add new tests for any new features or bug fixes when applicable.

4. Create Well-Scoped Pull Requests (PRs)
Keep pull requests small and focused on a single feature, bug fix, or improvement.
Provide a clear description of what your PR does, why it's needed, and any relevant context or screenshots.
Reference any related issues in the PR description (e.g., "Closes #123").

5. Respect the Branching Strategy
Create feature branches off the main branch (or the appropriate base branch, like develop if specified).
Use descriptive branch names (e.g., feature/add-login, bugfix/fix-crash).
Avoid committing directly to protected branches like main.

6. Communicate and Collaborate
If you're addressing an existing issue, comment on the issue to let others know you’re working on it.
Be open to feedback during code reviews and respond constructively.
If you have questions or need clarification, reach out via GitHub issues or other designated communication channels.

7. License and Ownership
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's license (see LICENSE file).
Ensure that your contributions are your own and do not violate any third-party licenses or intellectual property rights.
